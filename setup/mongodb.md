# Set up your own MongoDB Atlas Cluster in the Cloud

This course will be using MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based Mongo service, for hands-on exercises.

## 1. Sign up for MongoDB Atlas

Follow the instructions in the **[How To video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-tIfDCb-T4)** for setup.

I recommend using a Google account to **[create your Atlas MongoDB Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)**. But you can create an account with any valid email address.

## 2. Update the IP access list

In order to reach the MongoDB Atlas cloud service from the UVA HPC cluster (or other locations on grounds), you have to update the list of IP addresses allowed to connect to the service. This is called `whitelisting`.

1. In the MongoDB Atlas web interface, click on `Database & Network Access` on the left-hand sidebar (grouped under `Security`).
2. On the next screen click on `IP Access List`.
3. Click the `+Add IP ADDRESS` button and add the `128.143.0.0/16` address as `UVA Block 1`. Repeat this step for the `199.111.0.0/16` address as `UVA Block 2`. In CIDR notation, the number after the slash (e.g. `/16`) is the prefix length: it indicates how many bits define the network, so `/16` allows all IPs in that network block (e.g. 128.143.0.0 through 128.143.255.255).

The IP Access list should look similar to this:

Your address entry next to `Created as part of the Auto Setup process` is likely different. The `Home network` address is not needed unless you want to access the MongoDB Atlas cluster from off-grounds.

## 3. Get Connection String (URL)

1. In the MongoDB Atlas web interface, click on `Database` > `Clusters` (left side menu). In this case the cluster is named `ds2002`. You may have chosen a different name during setup, which is fine.

2. Click on the `Connect` button of your cluster and select `Shell - Quickly add & update data using MongoDB's Javascript command-line interface`. This will give you a `connection string` similar to this:

```bash
mongosh "mongodb+srv://ds2002.tmwdrjn.mongodb.net/" --apiVersion 1 --username <username>
```

The `connection URL` is the part between the pair of `"`. In this case: `mongodb+srv://ds2002.tmwdrjn.mongodb.net/`, **yours will be different.**

- If the URL extends beyond `...mongodb.net/`, delete it from the connection string.
- Replace `<username>` with the user you created when you signed up for MongoDB Atlas.

## 4. Save Connection String

Open your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`) and add the following export statements:

```bash
export MONGODB_ATLAS_URL="<YOUR_CONNECTION_URL>"  # e.g. mongodb+srv://ds2002.tmwdrjn.mongodb.net/
export MONGODB_ATLAS_USER="<YOUR_USERNAME>"
export MONGODB_ATLAS_PWD="<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
```

## Install the `mongosh` client on your computer

**Mac users:**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run:

```bash
brew install mongosh
```

3. Confirm installation:

```bash
mongosh --version
```

**WSL/Linux (Ubuntu):**

Prefer the package manager. Most WSL setups are Ubuntu; add MongoDB’s apt repository, then install `mongodb-mongosh`:

```bash
# 1. Import MongoDB's public GPG key
wget -qO- https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-8.0.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/server-8.0.asc

# 2. Add the MongoDB apt repository for your Ubuntu release (jammy, noble, etc.)
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)/mongodb-org/8.3 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.3.list

# 3. Install mongosh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-mongosh
```

If `gnupg` is missing when importing the key, run `sudo apt-get install -y gnupg` and retry steps 1-3.

Confirm:

```bash
mongosh --version
```

For other Linux distros, see the official [mongosh install docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/).
